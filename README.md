üõ°Ô∏è A Privacy-First Studio
Never Never Studios is a privacy-first game studio. We believe that your data is your own. Our promise to you is simple:

No unnecessary permissions: We will never ask for access to your device's data unless it is absolutely essential for a core gameplay feature.

No data selling: We will never sell or share your data with third parties.

No tracking: We do not include invasive trackers or analytics in our games. Your gameplay is your business.

Featured Project: Retro Snake - Pixel Art Edition
Our debut title is a modern, offline-ready reimagining of the classic arcade game, built with deep customization and a retro pixel art aesthetic. This isn't just a clone; it's a complete retro console experience in your browser, designed to be installed on your phone as an offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA).

üéÆ Gameplay Features
Dynamic Power-ups: Collect a variety of items that change the gameplay, including Ghost Mode, Star Power (for invincibility), Food Magnets, and Length Cutters.

Coin Collection System: Gather coins that spawn after eating food. Collect enough in a single run to trigger a massive reward and bonus powers!

Challenging Obstacle Mode: Toggle skulls on the map for a much harder game. Playing with this mode enabled grants a 50% score bonus.

Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose from Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard to tailor the game speed and scoring to your skill level.

Combo System: Quickly chain item and food collections to build a combo meter for huge score multipliers.

‚öôÔ∏è Deep Customization
Unlockable Content: Progress through the game by eating food across all your sessions to unlock dozens of new cosmetic items.

Game Themes & Phone Colors: Completely change the look of the game screen and the surrounding "phone" console with themes like Classic, Noir, Synth, and Terminal.

Snake Skins & D-Pad Styles: Customize your snake with unique patterns like Emerald Viper and change the look of the on-screen controls with styles like Brushed Aluminum and Anodized Metal.

‚ö° Performance Tuning
Graphics Modes: Choose between Performance, Quality, Ultra, and GOD modes to balance visual fidelity with battery life. Higher modes add more detailed 3D-style blocks and shimmer effects.

FPS Capping: Lock the framerate to 30, 60, or 90 FPS to ensure a smooth experience on any device or to conserve battery.

üöÄ Coming Soon
Keep an eye out! Retro Snake is coming to the Google Play Store.
